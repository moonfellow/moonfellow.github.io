  <h1>did you see it did you see it did you know it did you feel it</h1>

There is something deadly in the air of the Republican National Convention. All the delegates are hypochondriacs with beautifully grainy noses. They have wide necks and sunken alabaster mandibles. They have abstract ideas of tumors, spies, mutants. They roll onto the stage one by one, alleging Jewish-Chinese alliances, signalling covert stock alerts, peddling crypto-currencies. The idea of pyrotechnics goes off. The trumpets are steady and unquenchable.
Two promising staffers from the backwaters of Kentucky mull over the attendance. “Have you noticed a dwindling?”
“In what?”
“I don’t know. Headcount, maybe.”
“Hoffman retired. So did Sharp, the two Harpers, Lindsey, Werner, Slater. Schultz is on sabbatical, and Hanson will be leaving soon. I can tell. He’s ashamed.”
“I heard he’s in trouble for skipping jury duty.”
“He’s a professional apologist. I mean a lawyer. He grovelled to the judge.”
They nod.
“A general dwindling, then.”
“What do you mean?”
“In life force. It seems like everyone is older than they are, or closer to death. The kind of proximity that gives you the leeway to do whatever you can still do. And say whatever you can still say. I can’t remember if I signed up for this.”
“You did. There was a form.”
“There’s always a form.”
“Or maybe it was a spreadsheet.”
“It was a form that became a spreadsheet.”
“Most forms do that.”
“Most forms conform.”
“It just feels right.”
“I do know what you mean. I can feel it too. The dwindling. All of the speakers have ghostwriters, and all of the ghostwriters have ghosts writing. But the ghosts have their own codices of reference, so nothing lands. Nothing sticks.”
“Yes.”
“Everything is dictated.”
“Yes.”
“And the one giving the speech feels that something is wrong.“
“Yes.”
“But they don’t realize what the source is.”
“Yes.”
“And maybe they think they’re onto something, or maybe they don’t. Maybe they think themselves victims of a terrible disease, or passengers on a plane tumbling through the air with no pilot, or children at the end of a very long line at the fair. And the great reveal is that the stall is out of candy or chocolate or stuffed animals, and they’ve wasted the day standing in the heat, and it’s time to leave, but they can’t, they can’t move by themselves. They have to be pulled away. They want to be ripped and dragged away.”
“Yes. Yes, you’re right.”
“I’m Janet Janice, by the way. I’m with Colin Anderson.”
“Harold. Nice to meet you. I’m with Wilson. Look, he’s on the stage now.”
A moment of silence. Suspend your disbelief: they have hopes of being ambitious and dreams of age regression, subconsciously emulating the affects of characters they encountered as children, when the women were women and the men were men, and all problems could be put to sleep with guesswork. They are unreliable narrators, detectives, prisoners, social climbers. For the moment, they handle communications for their respective representatives. In twenty years, they will marry and copulate and embark on road trips to the Pacific Northwest. An air of solitude will settle in the cul-de-sac where their children will be fattened on raisin bread and deceptively multicultural soup before blossoming into adults who carry the guilt of having exceptionally plain origins, and they will forget their unremarkable introduction at the delegation luncheon speeches of the 2050 Republican National Convention, and Janet Janice will die before Harold, and he will shave his head and remarry a Korean woman named Minyoung.
