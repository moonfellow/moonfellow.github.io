  <h2>just how similar are the smiths songs?</h2>
  
  <p>A while ago one of my friends hypothesized that there were two genres of The Smiths songs: a slower, meandering type (think “Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want”), and a faster, somewhat jolly type with heavier instrumental (think “Frankly, Mr. Shankly). Or in other words, depressing and less depressing. Here's my attempt to test that hypothesis, with the power of Track Analysis API and Plotly.</p>

  <h2>mapping the similarity of the above three features on a scatterplot</h2>

  <p>As it turns out, there *aren't* two distinctive types of The Smiths songs, just a denser region with some outliers ("London," "The Draize Train", etc), which also happen to be less popular. At the same time the results are a little sketch because there are only so many track features offered by the Track Analysis API. Oh well :( Come back another day for a more satisfying analysis...</p><br><br>
