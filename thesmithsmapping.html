  <h2>just how similar are the smiths songs?</h2>
  
  <p>A while ago one of my friends hypothesized that there were two genres of The Smiths songs: a slower, meandering type (think “Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want”), and a faster, somewhat jolly type with heavier instrumental (think “Frankly, Mr. Shankly). Or in other words, depressing and less depressing. Here's my attempt to test that hypothesis.</p>

  <h2>track features</h2>

  <h2>energy</h2>

  <h2>danceability</h2>

  <h2>instrumentalness</h2>

  <h2>mapping the similarity of the above three features on a scatterplot</h2>

  <p>As it turns out, there aren't two distinctive types of The Smiths songs, just a denser region with some outliers ("London," "The Draize Train", etc). Oh well :(</p>
