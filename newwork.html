    There is something deadly in the air of the Republican National Convention. All the delegates are hypochondriacs with beautifully grainy noses. They have wide necks and sunken alabaster mandibles. They have abstract ideas of tumors, spies, mutants. They roll onto the stage one by one, alleging Jewish-Chinese alliances, signalling covert stock alerts, peddling crypto-currencies. The idea of pyrotechnics goes off. The trumpets are steady and unquenchable.
“Have you noticed a dwindling?”
“In what?”
“I don’t know. Headcount, maybe.”
“Hoffman retired. So did Sharp, the two Harpers, Lindsey, Werner, Slater. Schultz is on sabbatical, and Hanson will be leaving soon. I can tell. He’s ashamed.”
“I heard he’s in trouble for skipping jury duty.”
“He’s a professional apologist, he grovelled to the judge.”
Hundreds of miles away, in a boiling garage in Tacoma, a vaguely skinny, vaguely unhappy young man is watching. The livestream is muted. There are all the signs, and no explanation. Messages manage to float through, thin and purely semiotic. Noah is superstitious about listening. Some creatures no longer limit themselves to the margins. Now, they interact freely with men. You will not always be able to escape and return. You must marry or tame or kill them. 
Noah blinks. He lights a joint. In his dreams, his mother is either very old or very young, and his father is someone else. Smoke curls over an opened chest, a deck of blank checks, his movie poster collection. The cinema sometimes hands them out without charge at the end of theatrical runs; he’s saved sixteen so far. He takes another hit. The sticky heat of the garage softens into something consoling. In high school, he stole two thousand dollars worth of hardware. He briefly and furiously studied statistics at Tacoma Community College before the committee dismissed him. It was only two semesters of academic probation. Now he is working towards a mechanic certificate. Certain good things have been wasted on him. Certain good things are only for other people.
He habitually lies by omission, according to Anika.
He is no longer paying attention to the livestream. Once he looks away, the faces of the party officials twist, growing bulbous, swelling into squirming approximations of human features. One sprouts two Aryan heads, another’s hands fatten and melt into huge meaningless symbols. The great mass of the audience becomes a kaleidoscope of gaping portals and ecstatic voids. They are reduced to a current of fractal eyes.
He turns. On the feed is a procession of red.
